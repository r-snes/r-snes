# 🧩 Legal & Ethical Overview – SNES Emulator Project (France)

## 1. Purpose of this Document
This document summarizes the **legal framework, ethical considerations, and compliance strategy** for the development of a **Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator** in France.  
Its goal is to ensure that the project respects French and European copyright law and promotes responsible, lawful use.

---

## 2. Disclaimer

> **Legal Notice**  
> This emulator is an independent, clean-room reimplementation of the SNES hardware.  
> It contains **no copyrighted material** belonging to Nintendo or other rights holders.  
> Users must ensure they **own the original game cartridges** before creating or using ROMs.  
> The authors **do not condone or support piracy** in any form.

## 3. Legal Context in France

### 3.1 Emulator Legality
Developing and distributing an emulator is **legal in France**, provided that:

- The emulator is **written from scratch** (clean-room implementation).
- It **does not contain proprietary BIOS or firmware code** from the original console.
- It **does not circumvent technical protection measures** in violation of copyright.

> ✅ Emulator code = legal  
> ❌ Including BIOS or copyrighted console firmware = illegal

---

### 3.2 Private Copy Exception (*Copie Privée*)
Article **L122-5** of the French *Code de la propriété intellectuelle* authorizes private copies **only when made from a lawful source** and **for strictly personal use**.

This means:
- A user **may dump their own cartridge** to create a ROM for personal use.  
- A user **may not download or share ROMs** obtained from unauthorized sources.

> ✅ Dump your own cartridge for personal use  
> ❌ Download or share ROMs online  
> ❌ Redirect towards non-offical ROM sources

---

### 3.3 Decompilation and Reverse Engineering
Under **EU Directive 2009/24/EC** and its French transposition:

- **Reverse engineering** is allowed *only* to achieve **interoperability** between programs.  
- It must:
  - Be **necessary** for compatibility.
  - Be done by a **lawful user**.
  - Not disclose or reuse original copyrighted code beyond what’s required.

This may apply to emulator development if the work remains minimal, justified, and well-documented.

---

### 3.4 Distribution Risks
Distributing copyrighted assets remains **strictly prohibited**:
- **ROMs**, **BIOS**, and **firmware** files cannot be shared or bundled.
- **Facilitating piracy** (e.g., linking to ROM sites or providing pre-loaded builds) can result in liability for infringement or complicity.

> 🚫 Do not distribute copyrighted assets  
> 🚫 Do not link to ROM websites  
> ✅ Distribute emulator code only

---

## 4. Ethical Guidelines

1. **Preservation and education**  
   - Emphasize historical preservation and technical learning.  

2. **Lawful use only**  
   - Encourage users to use their *own legally obtained* games.  

3. **Transparency**  
   - Include clear copyright disclaimers in documentation and user guides.

## 5. Compliance Strategy

| Category | Project Practice | Legal Basis |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Emulator core | 100% clean-room code, no proprietary content | Legal to develop and distribute |
| ROM files | Not included, not linked | Art. L122-5 – Private copy exception |
| BIOS / Firmware | Not distributed, not reverse-engineered | Copyright law |
| User ROM dumps | Allowed if from owned cartridges | Private copy exception |
| Reverse engineering | Minimal, interoperability only | Directive 2009/24/EC |
| Documentation | Includes disclaimer & use policy | Best practice |

---

## 6. Summary
Developing an emulator is **legally permitted in France** when done responsibly.  
The main legal risks arise from distributing **copyrighted ROMs or firmware**, not from creating the emulator itself.  
By following clean-room principles and respecting interoperability and private-copy limits, this project stays within both the **legal** and **ethical** boundaries of software development.

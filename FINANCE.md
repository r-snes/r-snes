# 💸 Financial Overview – SNES Emulator Project (France)

## 1. Purpose of this Document
This document outlines the **financial framework** of the SNES Emulator project, which is developed as a **non-commercial, open-source software**.  
Its purpose is to ensure transparency regarding funding, expenses, and compliance with legal restrictions related to commercial exploitation of emulation software.

---

## 2. Project Nature
- **Type:** Open-source educational project  
- **Goal:** Develop a clean-room SNES emulator for preservation, study, and community learning  
- **Commercial intent:** None  

The emulator will be released under an open-source license (e.g., MIT or GPL), ensuring free access and modification rights for all users.

---

## 3. Funding Policy

### 3.1 No Commercial Sales
To maintain compliance with intellectual property laws and to avoid potential disputes with console manufacturers or rights holders:
- The emulator will **not be sold or monetized**.  
- **No premium versions, ads, or paid features** will be implemented.  
- The software will remain **fully free** and open-source.

---

### 3.2 Donations
While direct sales are excluded, **voluntary donations** are legally acceptable and ethically consistent with the open-source model.

#### Conditions for donations:
- Donations are **entirely voluntary** and **not tied to access or features**.  
- Funds serve **only to support development and maintenance** (not payment for copyrighted content).  
- The emulator itself remains **free for everyone**, regardless of donation status.  
- Donation platforms (e.g., GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Liberapay) will include clear disclaimers:
  > “Donations are voluntary and support development.  
  > The emulator is distributed for free and contains no copyrighted game content.”

This approach ensures compliance with French and EU law by keeping a clear boundary between **financial support** and **commercial activity**.

---

### 3.3 Commissioned Plug-ins and Extensions
In the future, the project may allow **third-party plugin development** as a form of **commissioned work**, following models used by open-source artists and developers.

#### Concept
- Developers can offer to **create plug-ins or extensions** (e.g., debugging tools, visual filters, or front-end interfaces) in exchange for **commission payments**.  
- These plug-ins will extend the emulator but remain **separate, optional add-ons**.  
- This model compensates contributors for **creative or technical labor**, not for access to or ownership of the emulator itself.

#### Ownership Models
Two ownership structures will be allowed:
1. **Public release:**  
   - After completion, the commissioned plug-in is **released publicly** under an open-source license.  
   - The commissioner effectively funds the creation for community benefit.

2. **Exclusive release:**  
   - For a higher agreed-upon price, the **rights to the plug-in** may be **transferred to the commissioner**.  
   - The developer forfeits further distribution rights, and the commissioner decides how to use it (within legal and ethical limits).

#### Compliance and Restrictions
- Plug-ins must be **independent** of copyrighted SNES content and must **not include or rely on proprietary ROMs or BIOS files**.  
- All transactions for commissioned work occur **outside the main project’s financial structure**.  
- The emulator core remains **non-commercial**, and **no official endorsement or profit-sharing** will be involved.

This model supports sustainable open-source development while maintaining **strict legal compliance** and **ethical transparency**.

## 4. Expenses and Resource Use

The project’s estimated expenses are minimal and relate only to lawful research and testing.

| Category | Description | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| SNES Cartridges | Purchase of original cartridges for testing and lawful ROM dumping | €100–€200 | Required for private-copy testing |
| Cartridge Dumper / Adapter | Hardware to extract ROM data from owned cartridges | €50–€100 | Optional, for accurate emulation testing |
| Development Tools | Existing hardware and software (PC, compiler, debugger) | €0 | Already available |
| Miscellaneous | Storage, repository hosting, documentation tools | €0–€20 | Optional donations to GitHub / open-source infrastructure |

> **Total Estimated Development Cost:** €150–€300 (self-funded)

All expenditures relate to **testing, research, and documentation** — not to the acquisition or distribution of copyrighted material.

---

## 5. Financial Transparency and Reporting
If donations are accepted:
- All funds will be **publicly accounted for** through the donation platform’s history.  
- No private or hidden funding channels will be used.  
- The project maintainer(s) may publish **annual or periodic updates** summarizing the use of funds (optional but recommended for transparency).  
- **Commissioned plug-ins** remain the responsibility of the **individual developer and client**, with **no financial overlap** with project funds.

## 1. Purpose of this Document

## 2. Project Nature
- **Type:** Open-source educational project  
- **Goal:** Develop a clean-room SNES emulator for preservation, study, and community learning  
- **Commercial intent:** None  

The emulator will be released under an open-source license (e.g., MIT or GPL), ensuring free access and modification rights for all users.

## 3. Funding Policy

### 3.1 No Commercial Sales
To maintain compliance with intellectual property laws and to avoid potential disputes with console manufacturers or rights holders:
- The emulator will **not be sold or monetized**.  
- **No premium versions, ads, or paid features** will be implemented.  
- The software will remain **fully free** and open-source.

---

### 3.2 Donations
While direct sales are excluded, **voluntary donations** are legally acceptable and ethically consistent with the open-source model.

#### Conditions for donations:
- Donations are **entirely voluntary** and **not tied to access or features**.  
- Funds serve **only to support development and maintenance** (not payment for copyrighted content).  
- The emulator itself remains **free for everyone**, regardless of donation status.  
- Donation platforms (e.g., GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Liberapay) will include clear disclaimers:
  > “Donations are voluntary and support development.  
  > The emulator is distributed for free and contains no copyrighted game content.”

This approach ensures compliance with French and EU law by keeping a clear boundary between **financial support** and **commercial activity**.
